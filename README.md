# MyCalculator
Based off of Chapter 6-7 program of Bjarne Stroustrup's "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++"

As stated, program is based off Bjarne's calculator program, however, it has been modified slightly.
Modifications by me:
1.) Calculator is designed only to handle one expression at a time instead of multiple
2.) Calculator can handle expressions like 8*(2) and 8(2)
3.) Calculaotr provides an intro prompt
4.) Calculator contains a few additional error checks
5.) Some functions have been renamed for clarity
6.) Some consts have been renamed and might use different chars for clarity
7.) When declaring variables, program returns clear prompts to indicate a variable has been declared

Future additions to be made:
*add a clear option to clear screen
*add a reset option to reset a stored variables
*add more error checks
