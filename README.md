# MyCalculator
Based off of Chapter 6-7 program of Bjarne Stroustrup's "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++"

As stated, program is based off Bjarne's calculator program, however, it has been modified slightly.
Modifications by me:
*Calculator is designed only to handle one expression at a time instead of multiple
*Calculator can handle expressions like 8*(2) and 8(2)
*Calculaotr provides an intro prompt
*Calculator contains a few additional error checks
*Some functions have been renamed for clarity
*Some consts have been renamed and might use different chars for clarity
*When declaring variables, program returns clear prompts to indicate a variable has been declared

Future additions to be made:
*add a clear option to clear screen
*add a reset option to reset a stored variables
*add more error checks
